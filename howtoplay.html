			  <p class="lead">Gomoku or Go-moku or Five in line, is a traditional oriental game, originally from China. In Japanese language Go means five, and moku pieces (or eyes or dots).</p>
			  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Steps to Play </h2>
			<ul class="steps"> 
				<li>Know your opponent. For live games find information about your opponent. Check his game history on Gomokuworld. Find out his theory knowledge, his style, his mental strength. Ask some players who know him and simply find out as much relevant information as you can.</li>
				<li>Play with better players and challenge them. If you want to get better, you have to play with better players and compete with their minds. Playing weak players all the time will not challenge your brain.</li>
				<li>Study the games of great players – don’t just check the moves, try to stop after each move and think why the player moved there and what was his plan. Later you can even try to think of a better move for the position.</li>
				<li>In the training try to outplay the opponent, not just use an opening/scheme he doesn’t know. Try to reach the feeling that you play better than him. It’s much better than just win. </li>
				<li>If you know you have weaknesses, focus on them. If you want to improve shortcomings like theory, positional game, too slow thinking etc. you have to train them. Otherwise opponents will use these weaknesses against you.</li>
				<li>Play more live games, which is a totally different experience than the Internet. The excitement, tension and emotions are so much higher than in the Internet. Training live on boards will help you get used to it and improve your live tournament skill.</li>
